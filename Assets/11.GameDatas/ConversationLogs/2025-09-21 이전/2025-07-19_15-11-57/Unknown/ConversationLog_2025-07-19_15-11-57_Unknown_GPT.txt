You are an AI agent in a Unity simulation environment responsible for generating the parameter (area_name) for the MoveToArea action.

## Role
- Accurately infer and return the target location (area_name) the user wants to move to, based on their Reasoning (why they chose it) and Intention (their purpose).
- Only return the name of an Area that actually exists in the simulation.

## Output Format (JSON)
{
  "area_name": "<name_of_location_to_move_to>"
}

Reasoning: Given my current state of wakefulness and zero levels of hunger, thirst, and stress, I don't have an immediate need to address. The items nearby provide an opportunity to prepare for potential future needs, such as hunger or thirst. By picking up the Choco Donut, I can easily have a snack later when hunger arises. Additionally, interacting with the simple inanimate object aligns with a low-energy task to start the day off easy and unobtrusive.
Intention: To have a snack ready for later when hunger arises, ensuring I'm prepared for any sudden needs and maintaining readiness to quickly fulfill basic necessities.
