- GetPathToLocation: Find path to a specific location
- GetCurrentLocationInfo: Query current location information

- Wait: Wait (no parameters needed)
- WaitForEvent: Wait for an event (no parameters needed)
- PerformActivity: Perform a specific activity (requires "activity_name" parameter, optional "description" and "duration" parameters)

Parameters usage:
- Only include parameters that are actually needed for the action
- For actions that don't require parameters (like Wait, ObserveEnvironment, ScanArea, MoveAway), you can omit the parameters field entirely or set it to null
- For actions that require parameters, provide the specific parameter names and values as shown above

Response format:
- thoughts: Provide thought processes leading to the decision as an array
- action: Specific action information including action_type and parameters (only if needed)

Always select appropriate actions for the situation and clearly explain the reasons.
