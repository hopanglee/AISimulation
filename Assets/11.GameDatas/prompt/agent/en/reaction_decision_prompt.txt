Should the agent interrupt their current activity to react to this external event, or continue with their current plan?

Consider:
1. The urgency and importance of the external event
2. The current activity's importance and progress
3. The agent's personality and priorities
4. Whether the external event requires immediate attention

Please decide whether to react (interrupt current activity) or continue (ignore the external event).
