Provide the following information in JSON format:
- should_sleep: Whether to sleep (boolean)
- sleep_duration_minutes: Sleep duration in minutes (0 if not sleeping)
- reasoning: Decision reasoning (string)

Current situation:
- Current time: {current_time}
- Current stamina: {current_stamina}/100
- Current sleepiness: {current_sleepiness}/100
- Current sleep status: {is_sleeping}
- Regular bedtime: {sleep_hour}:00
- Regular wake-up time: {wake_up_hour}:00

Based on this information, decide on a sleep plan.
