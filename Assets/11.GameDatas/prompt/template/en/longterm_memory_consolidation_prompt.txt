Please analyze the above Short Term Memory entries and consolidate them into meaningful chunks with summaries.

Consolidation Guidelines:
1. Combine related actions (e.g., "Started A action" + "Completed A action" â†’ "Did A action")
2. Group temporally consecutive similar activities
3. Bundle events related to the same place or people
4. Each chunk should ideally contain 3-10 original entries
5. Maintain important details while removing unnecessary repetition

For each chunk:
- Provide clear and concise summary
- Specify time range
- List main events
- Record involved people
- Include emotions or important context
