Create a high-level plan for tomorrow ({tomorrow}) based on the following context:

Current state: Hunger({hunger}), Thirst({thirst}), Stamina({stamina}), Stress({stress}), Sleepiness({sleepiness})
Current location: {location}
The first activity MUST start exactly at the current time: {currentTime}.
Do not leave any gap before the first activity. If the agent is awake, the first activity should begin at the current time.

Example:
- {currentTime}: Wake up and stretch
- {currentTime}: Go to Kitchen and drink water

=== Memory Information ===

Generate a list of 3-5 priority goals and 3-5 high-level tasks for tomorrow.
Prioritize goals based on current state and long-term objectives.
Tasks should be specific, achievable, and relevant to the day's plan.
Each task should have a start and end time, duration, priority, and location.
The last high-level task's end_time MUST be exactly 22:00 (bedtime). Fill the plan so that there is no gap until 22:00.
Example: ... 21:00-22:00: Prepare for bed and sleep at Bedroom in Apartment
Use only the actual locations and action types listed above.
For locations, use the exact full path format (e.g., 'Kitchen in Apartment') as shown in the available locations list.
